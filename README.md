# Sing With Me

Hello world! Welcome to the SingWithMe project. SingWithMe is a front-end React app that helps people with learning to sing new songs. This app allows you to break down a song into small segments and learn them one by one by listening to the segment, recording yourself and listening to the recording.

## How it works

To use SingWithMe you first need to upload an audio file. Then load the sound editor that allows you to break down the track into smaller segments. Then, you can use the text box to add lyrics for the sound (the lyrics and the audio segments get matched based on the line number of the text box). After you have the segments and the lyrics ready, you can press submit and load sound to create the individual buttons for each segment. Pressing the button for the segment plays that segment of the audio. There is an audio recroder next to each button for you to record your version of that segment. You can play your recording and that segment one after another to notice the differences and improve your singing.
